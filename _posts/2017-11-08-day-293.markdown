1/ **Trump told 12 Senate Democrats that he would "get killed" financially by the GOP tax bill** in an attempt to increase Democratic support by claiming the bill would hurt wealthy taxpayers like himself. Trump wants Democrats to support repealing the estate tax, because they need to give something to rich people.

2/ **Trump warned North Korea that developing nuclear weapons was putting the country in "grave danger."** Trump, during a speech to South Korea's National Assembly, called on all countries to isolate Pyongyang by denying it "any form of support, supply or acceptance," saying the "world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation" and to "not underestimate us and do not try us." Trump’s return to tough talk came a day after he had softened his rhetoric and asked Pyongyang to "[come to the table](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/11/07/day-292/#6-trump-urged-north-korea-to-come-to)" and "make a deal." ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-asia/trump-warns-rogue-regime-north-korea-of-grave-danger-idUSKBN1D809B))

3/ **Corey Lewandowski's "memory has been refreshed" about Carter Page's trip to Russia**. In March, Trump’s former campaign manager said he "never met Carter Page." On Tuesday, Lewandowski described Page as a "low-level volunteer" who had "no formal role in the campaign," and "to the best of my recollection, I don't know Carter Page." [Page testified last week](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/11/07/day-292/#1-carter-page-testified-that-he-rece) to the House Oversight Committee that he had asked Lewandowski and Hope Hicks for permission to travel to Moscow. After the trip, Page emailed Lewandowski, Hicks, Sam Clovis, JD Gordon, and then-Senator Jeff Sessions, about his trip to Russia, where he met with Russian officials and discussed the presidential campaign.

4/ **Leadership at the State Department is being "depleted at a dizzying speed,"** the president of the Foreign Service officers’ union said. State has lost 60% of its career ambassadors, who have retired or quit since January, nearly half of its career ministers are gone (down to 19 from 33), and 62 minister counselors have left since Labor Day – "and are still falling."

5/ **A fourth Trump judicial nominee has been deemed unqualified for the job by the American Bar Association**. Brett Talley has faced criticism for his 2013 blog post where he called on readers to "join the National Rifle Association" and characterized gun control legislation passed after the massacre at Sandy Hook as "the greatest attack on our constitutional freedoms in our lifetime." Talley was tapped by Trump for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.
